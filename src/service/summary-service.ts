Your task is to process this transcript and generate the meeting metadata object as described above. NEVER INCLUDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, NEVER ADD INFORMATION THAT ISNT IN THE TRANSCRIPT, AND NEVER INCLUDE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED OFFENSIVE OR INAPPROPRIATE. The output should be a JSON object that adheres to the specified format. Good luck!
